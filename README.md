I am a Dev & UX Accessibility Specialist at <a href="https://atos.net/en/">Atos</a>. I love to **learn** about new technology, **connect** with people around the world and **help** others get into tech as well.

I am <a href="https://developers.google.com/community/experts">Google Developer Expert</a> for Web Technologies since 2023.

I am the founder of <a href="https://accessibilityfirst.at/">Accessibility First</a>, where I share articles, tutorials and more about web accessibility in UX Design, Web Development, Testing and more. Articles are available in German, English, and Japanese.

I am a public speaker and give talks and workshops, as well as panel discussions about accessibility and how to get into tech as a selftaught developer.

<a href="https://www.accessibilityfirst.at/webinar-series">Check out my Accessibility Webinar series</a>, where I talk monthly about accessibility in the web development process, meaning design, development, testing, and more.

**Some doors have to be closed to make room for something new.**

Until Spring 2024
- I was an Open Source Maintainer and founde of <a href="https://www.yuriscodingclub.com/">YurisCodingClub</a>, an inclusive open source community. The projects were part of <a href="https://hacktoberfest.com/">Hacktoberfest</a> to help CodeNewbies get into open source and tech from an early stage.
- I was a mentor and CoC responder by 💟 at <a href="https://the-collab-lab.codes/">The Collab Lab</a> since 2021.
- I was regularly writing blog posts on DEV.to since 2021.

## Pull Requests I am proud of 😇
As an open source contributor, I attach great importance to adhering to guidelines, accurate work, detailed descriptions and much more. Developer communication is important to make the workflow simple and fluid and to guarantee a good developer experience. 

I am therefore particularly proud of these PRs and issues, as they reflect my way of working very well:
